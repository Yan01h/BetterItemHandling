# BetterItemHandling

A mod for Lethal Company that makes item handling easier. Primarily picking up items.

# Features

- Making it possible to swap the current item in hand with one on the ground without dropping the item
first. The same applies to when you are carrying a two handed item.

- Its also possible to double press g (or whatever bind you have to drop an item) to instantly
drop all scrap, making dodging worms or lighting strikes easier.  
**This can be turned of in the config**

- You can place all scrap instantly onto the deposit desk by holding you sprint key.  
**This can be turned of in the config**

So there's essentially no more need to manually drop and rearange items anymore.
