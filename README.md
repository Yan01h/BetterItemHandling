# BetterItemHandling

A mod for Lethal Company that makes item handling easier. Primarily picking up items.

# Features

Making it possible to swap the current item in hand with one on the ground without dropping the item
first. The same applies to when you are carrying a two handed item.

So there's essentially no more need to manually drop and rearange items anymore.

Its also possible to press g (or whatever bind you have to drop an item) on a empty slot to instantly
drop all scrap, making dodging worms or lightings easier.  
**This can be turned of in the config**
